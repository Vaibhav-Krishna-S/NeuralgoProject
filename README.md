# NeuralgoProject
This project performs binary sentiment classification on airline feedback, labeling reviews as positive or negative. It uses a simplified dataset, preprocessing text with tokenization, negation handling, and custom sentiment markers. A pipeline with TfidfVectorizer and MultinomialNB trains the model, evaluated using accuracy and cross-validation.
